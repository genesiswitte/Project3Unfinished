        <div class="intro4"> <p>Their most recent work, an exhibition called Beauty, was first shown in Vienna in 2019. This multimedia exhibition addressed the concept of beauty, why people feel attracted to it, how it is dealt with in daily life, and what positive effects beauty can have. The goal was to show that beautiful forms do not lack function, but rather, they are functions themselves. A whole book was created for this exhibition along with a typeface designed by Sagmeister & Walsh.</p></div>
